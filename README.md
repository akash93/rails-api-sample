# README [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/akash93/rails-api-sample.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/akash93/rails-api-sample)

Sample project following the [Ruby on Rails API tutorial]( http://apionrails.icalialabs.com )
with a few small tweaks

# Instructions
  * Clone the repo
  * Install gems using `bundle install --without production`
  * Run migrations using `rails db:migrate`
  * Run tests `rails test`
  * Run the server `rails server`

*PS* : The tutorial is 2 years old and uses rails 4 and outdated versions of other gems. I have made necessary syntax
updates to port it to work on Rails 5 and updated versions of the gems
